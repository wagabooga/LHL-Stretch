Write a program that takes any number of command line arguments, all strings, and reverses them before outputting them one at a time to the console.

Do NOT use JavaScript's Array.prototype.reverse or Array.prototype.join functions to solve this problem.

Assuming the program is named reverse.js, the following are a few example runs.

-node reverse.js 1 fish 2 fish
1
hsif
2
hsif
